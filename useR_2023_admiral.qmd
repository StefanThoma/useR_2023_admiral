# Problem to be solved

Need for end-to-end solution in R. 
Part of that is a package for data standards - transformation from sdtm to adam.

We didn't like in SAS: 
- Each company buys their own custom solutions form vendors
- Even if a new hire is SAS proficient they need to learn company specific workflow and 
- Very specific solutions for specific problems, not modular


Every company has essentially the same requirements for this task.

# Proposed solution

- Admiral!

- Not a Roche product! (Not sure where this fits best, maybe strategy)

::: {.notes}
talk two sentences what admiral does, and that its modular, etc. 
:::

# Challenges at startup

-  Convince higher ups & peers
    - Real problem needs to be solved, whats in it for the company? 
    - Already have some work done, e.g. partners or something solid
    - Aks for forgiveness, not for permission

-  Convince other companies


one team from the start

# Strategies
## Approach
-  Act quickly: 
    - Open source early
    - Communicate early
    - Get many companies involved
    - Focus on developing for general use
    
    
-  Community involvement
    - Users help development
    - Can give feedback, create issues
    - Can join devs

## Design
-  One `core` package +
    -  package for therapeutic area 
    -  internal company package
    
-  Consistent interface and design across all packages
    - Ensured via developers guide and CICD
    - Overlap of developers between packages

-  Modularity + templates for common / most more complex tasks

-  License is jointly owned
    - Admiral won't stop if one company exits
    - Monetisation of code not possible
    - Responsibility for maintanance
        - Package is never "done"

-  Seat at the table
-  No total dev control

## Attractive workplace
-  Use of R attracts talent
-  Open source development means transparency and more ethical 
-  Less hierarchies in dev team (different companies)
-  Autonomous work - everyone can chose which issues they want to work
-  Expanding network across companies
-  Knowledge is more easily transferable to other positions

::: {.notes}
Surprised to learn that Roche is *investing* into open source projects

# Notes
(These are just notes I took when meeting Ross)
Talk with Ross Farrugia

Collaboration: 
anyone could have done it separately -> many different packages eventually open sourced
___ start early to collaborate together! 
companies coming up to be listed as contributors, what do they need to do? 
makes comapnies more attractive



-> removes hierarchies: resources 50 50 with gsk: collaboration agreement
anyone can walk away any time. But everything done has to be open source
communicated already from the start, even though repo was private. 
after 6 months people test it from many different companies. 20 companies w/ 50 programmers - ~500 comments

roche and gsk own admiral core license

license means you need to maintain the package

do i talk about how roche wants to be distant from pharmaverse? 

challenge to have adjacent packages stay close to the core package

admiral dev defines package development strategies -> keeps packages close

how do we keep consistent with bigger pharmaverse? 

gordon is also in ophta admiral

people in core also check out and consult in the adjacent packages

core also makes reviews before release.

users will be used to admiral. will call out problems in any packages and make issues
